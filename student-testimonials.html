										<h2>Student Testimonials</h2>
									</header>
											<p>'Thomas was one of the best tutors I've met on Ringle. He was skilled at leading the conversation as he asked many great, interesting questions that made me think deeper about the topic of the conversation. I could see that he feels very passionate about teaching students on Ringle and that aspect of him made the class more enjoyable. He also gave me detailed feedback on how I can make myself sound more fluent and natural, which I would not have been able to figure out so clearly myself. Thank you for the class Thomas and I look forward to seeing you again soon!

											<p>'He is a great teacher! Some tutors focus on paraphrasing every single words I said. On the other hand he firstly points out the key points and he focuses on them when he paraphrases. I prefer his reviewing style! Honestly I don't know how to study when I get the tutor'r review in former style..haha... I just read the tutor's lecture note and memorize vocabulary. However, when I got Thomas's review note I can easily recognize what I have to study and improve!

											<p>'Most of the tutors I've experienced have been good, but this one is the best among them. I was able to speak well because he created a comfortable atmosphere for conversation, and it was a great help for me to listen to various examples along with appropriate feedback on my speaking habits. I recommend you to take the class. I want to see you again. Thank you.

											<p>'Everything is perfect. Perfect tutor. That's what I want to say. 
											'<br> <b>- Pep***</b>

											<p>'He was the best teacher I have met in Ringle in terms of correction capabilities!! I want to meet him again and again. 
											'<br> <b>- Kim***</b>
											</p>

											<p>'It's hard to take a class with Tom. Finally, I had a class with him today and I realized that why his class mostly full booked. No more words about him. Almost perfect!! 
											'<br> <b>- Jen***</b>
											</p>

											<p>'Thank you for today's lesson! Everything was perfect! It really helped me with detailed feedback and paraphrasing ! Hope to see you again :) 
											'<br> <b>- Dms***</b>
											</p>

											<p>'He led the conversation comfortably and friendly. I couldn't express it well because I talked in English after a long time, but nevertheless, the power to lead the class is great. The correction and explanation were also good. The perfect tutor!
											'<br> <b>- Sso***</b>
											</p>
											
											<p>'I have learned several interesting idiomatic phrases from Tom. His overall feedback right after each answer helps me keep what to improve and be cautious in mind. Moreover, every single sentence paraphrased by him was so beautiful. I would love to have more classes with him. 
											'<br> <b>- Shi***</b>
											</p>

											<p>'I think he has such a great insight to know what students particularly need to learn. I am surprised that this only 20 mins class can be this much interesting. 
											'<br> <b>- Hjk***</b>
											</p>

											<p>'He's the best. 
											'<br> <b>- Lee***</b>
