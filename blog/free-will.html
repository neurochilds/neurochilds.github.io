										I thought I believed in determinism. That all matter abides by fundamental physical laws. That the state of matter in the next moment will be determined by the state of matter in the current moment which was determined by the state of matter in the preceding moment. From the very first moment, the Big Bang, each proceeding moment evolved from its preceding moment as a result of matter and energy abiding by the fundamental laws of the universe. This means that, supposedly, as everything follows the laws of physics, everything that ever has happened and will happen was predetermined from the first moment and can be explained by the cause-effect relationships dictated by the laws of physics. There is therefore no room for humans to exert free will over their actions - the action they take in each moment is a result of the matter and energy that makes up their body abiding by the laws of physics.

										If consciousness is simply an emergent property of sufficiently complex and integrated information processing, and if our consciousness has no ability to influence our actions, why is the qualitative character of our conscious experiences consistent with one that would drive us to action. Why do we experience sensations associated with a risk of bodily harm, such as extreme heat or compression of a limb, as unpleasant? Why do we feel aversion to these experiences? And why do we experience sensations associated with evolutionarily advantageous events, such as forming strong social connections or orgasming, as intensely pleasurable? Why do we feel attracted to these experiences? If we cannot exert conscious control over our actions, and our sensory experiences are just a by-product of integrated information processing, why is the qualitative character of the experience consistent with that which would drive us to make the appropriate action in response to experiencing them (e.g., remove our hand from a fire, continue to make strong social connections, have sexual intercourse)?
									</p>

										Further, a world in which consciousness emerges from information processing, but has no ability to exert influence over the physical world, should appear exactly the same as a world in which consciousness does not emerge from information processing. If the conditions of the big bang were identical, these worlds should ‘act’ exactly the same. How bizarre that we should have evolved non-conscious entities that undergo long-winded and intricate debates over their conscious experiences. How are these unconscious circuits able to articulate that they feel like they are conscious beings, and in many cases give in-depth descriptions of what their conscious experience feels like? If it’s true that consciousness emerges from information processing but can’t influence the physical world, i.e. cannot influence the neural circuits that plan speech, that execute the motor command that control our speaking muscles, surely we would all speak and act as though we are unconscious? Me, writing this, right now - why would an unconscious being write this note? Which is the same as saying: why would a being that is conscious, but whose consciousness cannot influence his neural circuits, cannot influence his actions, write this note?
